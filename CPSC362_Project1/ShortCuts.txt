How to get the site up and running:

(From terminal)


C:\Users\Josh>
	type in: cd desktop
	type in: cd CPSC-362_Project1
	type in: cd CPSC 362_Project1 (yes do this twice, and if you have the project inside another folder,
					 you'll need to type in cd "the name of the folder you put in it"
					 before the 3 commands above.)

Once the terminal looks something like this:

	C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\GitHub Repos\CPSC-362_Project1\CPSC 362_Project1>
	Then you are in the corrert location to access the main file. Then you can run the line: set FLASK_APP=Main.py ( change set to export in on a mac)
	Once that has been typed in, you can run the webiste by typing in the terminal: python Main.py or flask run (both work)

After that the terminal will spit out a few lines that list a URL, 
you can take that URL and copy it into a internet tab and it will open the website.
URL should look something like this: http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000

NEXT, there is a few things that needed to get installed to make the project work properly. 
The first is BootStrap and the other is Flask. To install both of these, simple go to the terminal and type in:

pip install Flask

here is the link if anyone needs help: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/

python -m pip install bootstrap-py

here is the link if anyone needs help: https://pypi.org/project/bootstrap-py/

Youll also need to type in these command to the terminal:

pip install email_validator
pip install flask-wtf


If you are using pycharm, there is a different way to install these extensions that does not involve the terminal.
Simple open the project, navigate to the settings section. Scroll down on the left hand side to the tab Project: CPSC-362_Project1.
Click that and select the Python Interpreter which should bring up a page that list packages you can install. Simply click the + sign at the bottom
and type in the packages you want to install.

	The Packages are:
		Flask
		WTForms
		email-validator

After that, IF YOU ARE USING PYCHARM, the project should run fine. 
To make sure that IF YOU ARE USING PYCHARM and want to run the project without using the terminal. Make sure you do the following aswell.

Got to the top on the page and look for a little box next to the play button icon and a little bug icon. click that box 
and click "Edit configuration" Now that a tab has opened up, on the left hand side there is a drop down menu that says python, if you 
open that and select that as the interpreter, and set the script path tab on the right of that to the location on the Main.py file
(you can easily set it by clicking the folder icon to browse the location. Once this is set, the program will run the site through the Pycharm 
and to get the site up and running, you simply need to press the play button in the top corner to run the project and the site 
URL will be visable on the debug section at the bottom.
