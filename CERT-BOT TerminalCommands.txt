These should be the commands to run cert bot on the linux server using apache and ubuntu 20.04
Once it is up and running, we can use apache to encrypt the URL. If something is wrong, more detailed instructions can be

1) SSH into the server running your HTTP website as a user with sudo privileges.

2) Install snapd ( should already be installed on ubuntu 20.04)

3)Execute the following instructions on the command line on the machine to ensure that you have the latest version of snapd.

	> $ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core

4) Run this command on the command line on the machine to install Certbot.

	> $ sudo snap install --classic certbot

5) Execute the following instruction on the command line on the machine to ensure that the certbot command can be run.

	> $ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

6) Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration automatically to serve it, 
   turning on HTTPS access in a single step.
